# TODO

- [ ] [RSS](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/5-astro-api/4/) with [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/6-islands/4/)
- [ ] Buy font
- [ ] Replace favicon
- [ ] Check SEO stats
- [ ] Sitemap: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/
- [ ] [Ensure slugs are unique](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/12788)
- [ ] Clean up /public dir
- [ ] Symbols in footer: good example, see bottom of https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/
- [ ] SEO optimization; like fill in on each page:
  ```
  <meta name="description" content="A brief description of your page for search engines." />
  <meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3" />
  <meta name="author" content="Your Name or Company" />
  ```
- [ ] Fix proper 302 external redirects with adaptor; Astro does not support external redirects in redirect config. Currently handled with `Astro.redirect()`
- [ ] Explore more plugins of https://metafizzy.co/
- [ ] Posts should be chopped up in small pieces. Slugs ending with a number, like /about/website/1, signal to be part of a series of posts
- [ ] goto: home two_of(media, research, vault) tags about
- [ ] the first footer bar in the about posts has a link to "tags" and the instagram/scholar/dark mode icons
- [ ] color of the first footer bar is the tag color; this can extend to the current tag in the second footer bar to get a "current selection" effect
- [ ] the first footer bar can contain the View all button for the tag lists; otherwise it is not needed there
- [ ] sawtooth border should **only have sawtooth in the container (the middle content) part**, not outside that -- to lessen the agressive effect
